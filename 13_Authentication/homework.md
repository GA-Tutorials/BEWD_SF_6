#Reddit App Part 2

For this week's homework, you're going to create another Reddit clone app(sorry!).  This time we will be implementing two new features: User Login and Bootstrap.  A

#Part 0
Install Bootstrap in your app, and use it to style everything that you do.  At the very least, your app must have a Bootstrap navbar.

#Part 1 - Authentication
Use Devise to implement basic user login. Feel free to use the Rails Girls tutorial from class. Make sure to include the appropriate links to sign up and logout in the navbar.

#Part 2 - Posts
Create a Post model with a title, link, and user_id.  You'll need to associate the Post and User models correctly.

#Part 3 - Comments
Create a Comment model.  I'm not telling you what you need to include on the model!  Make sure you associate your Comment, Post, and User model correctly.

#Part 4 - Upvotes
Lastly, implement upvotes.  Start with voting on Posts and then add voting on comments if you have time.

Bonus: make sure a user can only vote each post once.
